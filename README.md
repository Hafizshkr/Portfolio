#### Why use React and Tailwind?

 React and Tailwind are among the most popular frameworks used in the industry, and these are the first frameworks that I have learned. I want to add value to myself, so why not use this knowledge to create my portfolio.

#### Why use Vite?

I chose Vite over create-react-app(CRA) due to its significantly faster performance. While CRA automatically installs all dependencies, Vite allows for manual installation of only required dependencies. This leads to a faster installation process. As it avoids installing unnecessary dependencies and takes up less space.
